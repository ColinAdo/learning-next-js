# Template File:
## Template file is same as layout file in that they display the child props
## In template when user navigate through routes of the same template, the state changes, the new instance of component is mounted, the DOM is recreated and effects are synchronized

## Templates are defined by exporting a function in a file called template.tsx or template.js
