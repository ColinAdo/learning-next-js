# Route handlers:
## Route handlers allow to ccreate a custom request handler fro a given route

# Route handler Conventions:
## The convention of route handlers is by using the behavior name of the request i.e GET, POST, PUT etc
## Its default file is route.tsx or route.jsx
## When route.tsx and page.tsx are defined in the same directory, route.tsx becauses the default file and hence conflicts within the file.
## To resolve the conflict, create api folder and move the route.tsx into it.
